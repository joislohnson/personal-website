Welcome! I'm Lois.

I describe myself as a public health data scientist with a unique blend of engineering, statistics, and epidemiology expertise. I have a particular interest in advancing violence prevention research and practice. In my current role as a Data Analyst & Advisor at the [North Carolina Institute for Public Health](https://sph.unc.edu/nciph/nciph-home/), I apply advanced quantitative analysis skills to investigate and address health inequities in North Carolina.

I'm an unapologetic promoter of open-source software in the field of public health and a part-time baker at a local grain farm.
