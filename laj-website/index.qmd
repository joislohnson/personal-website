Welcome! I'm Lois.

I describe myself as a public health data scientist with a unique blend of engineering, statistics, and epidemiology expertise. I'm a skilled creative problem solver and I love to collaboratively tackle complex, multi-faceted issues. I'm a promoter of open-source software in the field of public health, and I'm particularly passionate about building quantitative data capacity and confidence among people without technical backgrounds.

In my current role as a Data Analyst & Advisor at the [North Carolina Institute for Public Health](https://sph.unc.edu/nciph/nciph-home/), I apply advanced quantitative analysis skills to investigate and address health inequities in North Carolina. 

Outside of my data endeavors, I'm a part-time baker at a [local grain farm](https://redtailgrains.com/) and I run a fiction book club ([join us](https://bookclubs.com/clubs/6021809/join/55cabb/)!). On any given day, you can find me walking and snuggling with my dogs, trying new recipes, and working on a range of creative projects.
