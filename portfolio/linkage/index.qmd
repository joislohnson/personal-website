## Role & Contributions

Conducted a novel probabilistic data linkage of NC Violent Death Reporting System (NC-VDRS) and NC Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool (NC DETECT) to improve firearm and suicide event surveillance and identify prevention strategies. Supported dissemination efforts of the data linkage work through preparing technical reports, blogs, manuscripts, and presentations.
