# Overview

Working with secondary data in public health can be challenging. It often involves pulling data from dozens of sources (each with its own limitations), cleaning dozens of datasets, and merging dozens of datasets into a single file. I learn something every time I'm asked to support this process, whether it's a new-to-me data repository I can access, an R package that can eliminate 50 lines of code, or even a philosophical approach that pushes me to think more critically about the big picture.

In this blog, I discuss how I attempted to streamline the secondary data analyses for Wake County's 2025 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). I'll also reflect on the lessons I learned **this** time around.

Stay tuned for a more technical follow-up post with reproducible R code that walks through our process for developing the final tables!

# Approach

## Develop Prioritized Indicator List {#indicator-list}

CHNA's cover a wide range of topics, from Demographics, Access to Care, Community Cohesion, Reproductive & Child Health, and more. This makes it easy to accrue a very long list of indicators.

For this project, our team at NCIPH worked alongside the steering committee's Secondary Data Analysis Workgroup to collaboratively identify the most important indicators to collect for each topic. **Spending extra time in this phase of the project is well worth it.**

## Leverage Data Repositories

Because of the sheer amount of effort it takes to produce secondary data deliverables, we generally don’t have sufficient time to thoughtfully investigate and communicate trends from our thoroughly curated dataset.

For the 2025 Wake CHNA, we worked alongside our partners to simplify our approach: instead of tracking down and pulling 80+ indicators from their respective sources, **we suggested that we streamline secondary data analyses by sourcing *most* of our indicators from the [NC Data Portal](https://ncdataportal.org/) or [Cape Fear Collective’s Community Data Platform](https://healthycommunitiesnc.org/community-data)**.

## Develop Useful and Accessible Deliverables

Historically, secondary data tables are buried in dozens of pages in the final CHNA report. This is an issue for a few reasons:

1.  Integrating 80+ tables into a stylized Word document or PDF requires tedious programming alongside inevitable manual tweaks.

2.  Developing 80+ tables that comply with [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2 Level AA standards](https://policies.unc.edu/TDClient/2833/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=131329) in Word and PDF formats is extremely challenging.

3.  This format is largely useless for those who want to access the data!

# Process

## Getting Started

### Download Data

We pulled data from a variety of data sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau, the North Carolina State Center for Health Statistics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other key local, state, and federal agencies. Where possible, the team leveraged the following North-Carolina-specific secondary data tools to efficiently collect data: [North Carolina Data Portal](https://ncdataportal.org/) (NCDP) and [Cape Fear Collective’s Community Data Platform](https://healthycommunitiesnc.org/community-data). In this walk-through, I'll focus on the process we followed for the indicators we pulled from the [NCDP](https://ncdataportal.org/).

To download the data, navigate to **Data \> [Community Health Assessment](https://ncdataportal.org/community-health-needs-assessment/)**. For our analysis, comparisons were made between Wake County, North Carolina overall, and Mecklenburg County, so we selected **Wake County, NC** and **Mecklenburg County, NC** as our assessment locations. We then selected available indicators from our [prioritized list](#indicator-list), generated a report, and downloaded the data as an Excel table.

### Load Libraries

Now that we've downloaded the data, let's write some R code to begin working with the data. We'll start by loading the packages we need for our analysis.

```{r}
#| output: false

library(grateful) # package citations
library(tidyverse) # data wrangling
library(knitr) # report generation
library(tidyverse) # data wrangling
library(janitor) # clean up
library(labelled) # variable labels; compatible with dplyr 
library(readxl) # reading in excel files
library(gtsummary) # statistical tests and tables
library(gt) # Editing GT tables
library(openxlsx) # writing excel files
```

### Import Data

The file we outputted has 2 sheets. The first sheet is the report output, which includes the indicators, indicator metadata, and the values for each location. The second sheet contains the data sources for each indicator.

We'll import each sheet as it's own tibble so we can join the data sources to our indicator table.

```{r}
#| output: false

ncdp_file_path <- "data/input/nc-data-portal-report.xlsx"

## Data Portal Report ####
ncdp_report <- read_excel(ncdp_file_path) %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(-usa, -report_location)
## Data Sources ####
ncdp_data_sources <- read_excel(ncdp_file_path, sheet = 2) %>%
  clean_names() %>% 
  # Data category already exists in the report file
  select(-data_category) %>%
  mutate(
    # Create a new column for notes
    ncdp_notes = str_extract(source, "^Note:.*(?=Data Source:)"),
    # Extract the "Data Source: " prefix from the source column
    source = str_remove(source, ".*Data Source: "))


```

### Transform

Data harmonization is the next step of the process. In other words, we need to standardize the NCDP indicators into a unified format to allow for integration with the dozens of other datasets we pull from.

This step includes:

-   Joining the report table to data sources

-   [Tidying](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy.html) the data

-   Using existing variables to create new variables that match our harmonized format (ex. data category \> theme)

-   Standardizing variables

-   Cleaning (ex. removing leading or trailing white space)

```{r}
#| output: false

# TRANSFORM INDICATOR DATA INTO NEW FORMAT ####
ncdp_indicators <- ncdp_report %>%
  
  # Join data source information to the data portal report sheet
  left_join(
    ncdp_data_sources, 
    by = "data_indicator",
    relationship = "many-to-many") %>%
  
  # Pivot the data to a long format based on region
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(north_carolina, mecklenburg_county_nc, wake_county_nc),
    names_to = "region",
    values_to = "indicator_value") %>%
  
  rename(indicator_desc = indicator_attribute) %>%
  
  mutate(
    # Add notes
    notes = case_when(
      data_indicator == "Access - Childcare Cost Burden" ~ "The 2024 Annual Data Release for County Health Rankings used data from 2023 & 2022 for this indicator.",
      str_detect(source, "September 2024") ~ "This data is from September 2024.",
      TRUE ~ as.character(NA)),
    
    # Update region names
    region = case_when(

      region == "wake_county_nc" ~ "Wake County",
      TRUE ~ region),
    
    # Create indicator_bycategory variable
    indicator_bycategory = str_to_lower(str_extract(data_indicator, "by [^,]*")),
    indicator_bycategory = case_when(
      str_detect(indicator_bycategory, "age") ~ "by age",
      str_detect(indicator_bycategory, "by race alone") ~ "by race",

      indicator_bycategory %in% c("by year", "by time period", "by tenure") ~ NA,
      TRUE ~ paste(indicator_bycategory)),
    
    # Map data_category to theme
    theme = case_when(
      data_indicator == "Access to Care - Mental Health Providers" ~ "Mental Health & Substance Use",
      data_indicator == "Access - Childcare Cost Burden" ~ "Reproductive and Child Health",

      str_detect(data_category, "Physical") ~ "Housing, Neighborhood, & Physical Environment",
      str_detect(data_category, "Neighborhood") ~ "Housing, Neighborhood, & Physical Environment",
      str_detect(data_category, "Healthcare") ~ "Access to Care",
      data_category == "Health Behaviors" ~ "Mental Health & Substance Use",
      data_category == "Health Outcomes" ~ "Disease, Illness, & Injury",
      TRUE ~ paste(data_category)),
    
    # Create year_c variable
    year_c = str_trim(str_extract(source, "(?<=\\.)[^.]+(?=\\.$)")),
    
    # Clean up year_c
    year_c = case_when(
      str_detect(data_indicator, "Population Receiving SNAP Benefits") ~ paste(indicator_desc),
      str_detect(data_indicator, "High School Graduation Rate by Year") & indicator_desc == "2016-17" ~ "2016-2017",
      str_detect(data_indicator, "High School Graduation Rate by Year") & indicator_desc == "2017-18" ~ "2017-2018",
      str_detect(data_indicator, "Recreation and Fitness Facilities") ~ paste(indicator_desc),
      str_detect(data_indicator, "Grocery Stores and Supermarkets") ~ paste(indicator_desc),
      str_detect(data_indicator, "Uninsured Population Under Age 65, Percent by Year") ~ paste(indicator_desc),
      str_detect(data_indicator, "Adults with Diagnosed Diabetes by Year") ~ paste(indicator_desc),
      data_indicator == "Employment - Unemployment Rate" ~ "2024",
      year_c == "2018-22" ~ "2018-2022",
      year_c == "2020-21" ~ "2020-2021",
      year_c == "2017-21" ~ "2017-2021",
      year_c == "2023&2022" ~ "2024",
      year_c == "September 2024" ~ "2024",
      data_indicator == "Average Annual Unemployment Rate, 2013-2023" ~ paste(indicator_desc),
      TRUE ~ paste(year_c)),
    
    # Create year variable based on year_c variable
    year = if_else(
      str_detect(year_c, "-"),
      str_extract(year_c, "(?<=-)\\d{4}"),
      year_c),
    
    # Create indicator variable
    indicator = data_indicator,
    
    # Create type variable
    type = value_type) %>%
  
  # Remove data_category variable which was replaced by theme variable
  select(-data_category) %>%
  
  # Create new columns for numerator_desc and denominator_desc
  mutate(
    numerator_desc = if_else(str_detect(value_type, "numerator"), indicator_desc, NA),
    denominator_desc = if_else(str_detect(value_type, "denominator"), indicator_desc, NA)
  ) %>%
  
  # Separate rows where value_type has multiple values
  separate_rows(value_type, sep = ", ") %>%
  
  # Trim any extra spaces
  mutate(value_type = trimws(value_type)) 


```

The table still contains multiple rows per indicator because the NCDP output included separate rows for denominators. We'll further [tidy the data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy.html#sec-tidy-data) and harmonize to our standardized format.

Then we'll output the data.

```{r}
#| output: false

ncdp_tbl %>% write.xlsx("data/output/ncdp.xlsx")
```

### Merge

### Create Tables

### Output Tables

# Final Products

We developed an [HTML report](https://livewellwake.org/priorities/) with the data tables that meets WCAG 2.0 (Level AA) guidelines\* and a [downloadable dataset and data dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xOPjVWS8V2dPsNLEBXAe9KG9NQtau7qMNFX5kShiwso/edit?usp=sharing) with the secondary data shown in the report.

Ultimately, this means community members can:

1.  Visit the Live Well Wake website to [investigate the tables](https://livewellwake.org/priorities/) instead of scrolling to the appendix of the report document

2.  [Use the dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xOPjVWS8V2dPsNLEBXAe9KG9NQtau7qMNFX5kShiwso/edit?usp=sharing) to conduct their own exploratory analyses or create their own visualizations.

*\*Note: While the report meets WCAG 2.0 guidelines, the website it's hosted on does not.*

# Lessons Learned

## Stick to a Single Approach

While leveraging data repositories was helpful in streamlining the analysis of roughly 50% of our indicators, we still had to source data for the remaining half. Moving forward, I'd lean towards recommending a single approach to our partners (i.e., everything from NC data tools) to truly streamline these efforts, acknowledging that there may be a handful (3-10 max.) of indicators unique to local interests that we track down outside of the data tools. **This would free up our time, allowing us to focus on meaningfully interpreting, visualizing, and presenting the data**.

## Enhance Data Accessibility

The dataset and standalone HTML report of the tables is a step up from being buried in a 200-page document. However, there's work to be done to make the data more accessible. For example, I'd love think through how we can incorporate more interactive components for users. While several exciting and shiny ideas come to mind, **I'm interested in asking community members, folks from the steering committee, and our partners what's on their wishlist**.
