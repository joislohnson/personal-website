Welcome! I'm Lois.

I describe myself as a public health data scientist with a unique blend of engineering, statistics, and epidemiology expertise. I'm a skilled creative problem solver and I love to tackle complex issues collaboratively. I'm a promoter of open-source software in public health, and I'm particularly passionate about building quantitative data capacity and confidence among people without technical backgrounds.

I currently lead the Data Strategy & Analytics team at the [North Carolina Institute for Public Health](https://sph.unc.edu/nciph/nciph-home/). We provide advanced quantitative data skills to health departments, community-based organizations, and healthcare systems to improve the health of communities across North Carolina.

Outside of my data endeavors, I'm a part-time baker at a [local grain farm](https://redtailgrains.com/) and I run a fiction book club ([join us](https://bookclubs.com/clubs/6021809/join/55cabb/)!). On any given day, you can find me walking and snuggling with my dogs, trying new recipes, and working on a range of [creative projects](makes.qmd).
