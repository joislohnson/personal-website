# Personal Website

## Description
### Overview
This project is my personal website which highlights my background, resume/CV, data science portfolio, creative projects, and recommended data science resources. 

### Choosing Quarto
I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to learn how to build a Quarto website. I'm an R programmer with experience creating HTML and PDF documents in Quarto, so creating a Quarto website felt like an obvious next step in my personal _see-ya-RMarkdown-hello-Quarto-you-seem-cool_ mission.

Perhaps more importantly, as a Shiny dashboard developer, I've increasingly found myself considering projects where developing a Quarto website could be the preferred approach. This preference stems from a couple key advantages. First, I think Quarto has a gentler learning curve than Shiny. Opting for more intuitive programming tools paves the way for more efficient and collaborative development. Second, Quarto seems to have less quirks than Shiny, which seems to result in less complex dashboards/sites overall. This decreased complexity reduces the time and effort required to build and maintain the project.

### What I Learned
- Building your own website is really fun. It took me back to MySpace days! I originally thought the website would be professional tool. In the middle of development, I had the retrospectively obvious realization that I could include anything I wanted, so I decided create a page showcasing my creative projects. Seeing all of the things I've made in the past couple of years in a gallery makes me feel much more proud of myself then reviewing academic and professional accomplishments. These tiny personal joys remind me of Dr. Fonti Kar's  [2024 useR! talk "Why Build Silly Things in R?"](https://userconf2024.sched.com/event/1c8zy/why-build-silly-things-in-r-fonti-kar-university-of-new-south-wales?iframe=yes&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) ðŸ¤ 
- Quarto continues to blow me away with how easy it is to use. I initially felt intimated by the prospect of making my own website, but Quarto made the development process feel seamless!
- I think my intuition about Shiny dashboards vs. Quarto websites was spot-on. While I still see a need for both tools, you'll find me recommending Quarto websites more often given the organizational capacity limitations I'm up against.
