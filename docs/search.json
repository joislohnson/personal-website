This map shows that the most socially vulnerable communities are clustered together, concentrated in the East Central service zone and nearby tracts on the borders of the North Central, South Central, and West Central service zones. On the other hand, the least socially vulnerable communities are more distinctly spread across the county in the Northern, North Central, West, and South Central service zones. We can use this information to help inform which tracts and service zones county-level investments should go to."

This overlap suggests the initiative is targeting areas with high social vulnerability, but could do better. Expanding Opportunity Zone tract eligibility beyond poverty and income measures could lead to improved social vulnerability among communities that have been historically marginalized. Policymakers should consider additional investment incentive programs for communities with lower rates of educational attainment and higher rates of severe housing problems, for example."

Our team at the North Carolina Institute for Public Health (NCIPH) provided technical assistance for survey methods, analysis, and dissemination.\n\n\nData Analysis Workgroup\nTasked with providing capacity building support for wrangling, analyzing, and visualizing survey results, I helped form a Data Analysis Workgroup composed of faculty and students from all 10 universities within the HBCU HEDC.\nI‚Äôd be remiss not to mention some of the members of the workgroup: Dr.¬†Scott Bradshaw (ECSU), Dr.¬†Sabina Otienoburu (JCSU), Dr.¬†Cynthia Williams Brown (WSSU), Dr.¬†Martie Thompson (App State), Dr.¬†Sherry Leviner (FSU), Melvin Jackson (Shaw/UNC-CH), Dr.¬†Anderton-Georgie (Shaw), Dr.¬†Dorothy C. Browne (Shaw), Dr.¬†Nicole Diggs (NCCU), Dr.¬†Irene Doherty (NCCU), Dr.¬†Joe West (UNC Pembroke), Dr.¬†Yiqing Yang (WCU), Dr.¬†Ashley Sanderlin (NCAT), Dr.¬†Miriam Wagner (NCAT), DeNita Murdock-Nash (NC SCHS), Dr.¬†John Wallace (UNC-CH), and Jaquayla Hodges (UNC-CH). Shout-out to all of these amazing folks!\n\n\n\nIn-person meeting at NC A&T on January 25, 2024.\n\n\n\n\nLeveraging Open-Source Tools\nWe wanted to choose a primary programming language for the analysis. Understandably, members of the workgroup had a variety of preferred, mostly licensed programming languages. I selected R as the primary language because it‚Äôs free, open-source, conducive to literate programming and research reproducibility, and there‚Äôs an unparalleled volume of self-learning resources.\nOur team at NCIPH led R workshops, compiled relevant R resources, and developed shared code for transforming raw results, descriptive statistics, and univariate regression. The workgroup used R Markdown, Quarto, and Shiny to report results, ultimately using the output as a basis for coding and analysis decisions, exploratory analyses, and dissemination of findings to NC communities.\n\n\n\nImpact of workshops, shared code, R Markdown, Quarto, and Shiny.\n\n\n\n\nuseR! Talk\nIn July 2024, I had the opportunity to give a talk about this work at the useR! conference in Salzburg, Austria. In addition to the content mentioned above, I discussed how convening a Data Analysis Workgroup and using free, open-source R packages and tools can serve as an engaging framework to bolster data science education and autonomy.\nI encouraged fellow data scientists to:\n\nBreak out of the silo we too often find ourselves in by forming data workgroups tailored to project context\nDemystify data science by meaningfully engaging folks throughout the data lifecycle\nPromote data democratization by using free and open source tools (okay R!)"

It feels like the public health data harmonization olympics, where the events include pulling, transforming, merging, analyzing, and communicating head-spinning amounts of data that span almost a dozen topics.\nIt‚Äôs no surprise I learn something every time I‚Äôm asked to support this process, whether it‚Äôs a new-to-me data repository I can access, an R package that can eliminate 50 lines of code, or even a philosophical approach that pushes me to think more critically about the big picture.\nIn this blog, I discuss how our team at NCIPH attempted to streamline the secondary data analyses for Wake County‚Äôs 2025 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). I‚Äôll also reflect on the lessons I learned this time around.\nStay tuned for a more technical follow-up post with reproducible R code that walks through our process for developing the final tables!"

This makes it easy to accrue a very long list of indicators, and an excess of data makes it more challenging to identify key insights about the assets and needs of the community.\nSpending extra time in this phase of the project is well worth it. A more focused dataset tends to include higher quality data and does a better job at generating actionable insights and digestible data stories. For this project, we worked alongside the steering committee‚Äôs Secondary Data Analysis Workgroup to collaboratively identify the most important indicators to collect for each topic."

By the time we finally have a harmonzied dataset, it can feel like there isn‚Äôt enough remaining time to thoughtfully investigate and communicate trends from our thoroughly curated dataset.\nFor the 2025 Wake CHNA, we worked alongside our partners to simplify our pulling and harmonization efforts: instead of tracking down 80+ indicators from their respective sources, we suggested streamlining secondary data analyses by sourcing most of our indicators from the NC Data Portal and Cape Fear Collective‚Äôs Community Data Platform."

    "text": "Develop Useful and Accessible Deliverables\nHistorically, secondary data tables are buried in dozens of pages in the final CHNA report. This is an issue for a few reasons:\n\nIntegrating 80+ tables into a stylized Word document or PDF requires tedious programming alongside inevitable manual tweaks.\nDeveloping 80+ tables that comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2 Level AA standards in Word and PDF formats is extremely challenging.\nThis format is largely useless for those who want to access the data!\n\nWith these historical limitations in mind, we worked alongside our partners to develop an HTML report with the data tables that meets WCAG 2.0 (Level AA) guidelines* and a downloadable dataset and data dictionary with the secondary data shown in the report.\nUltimately, this means community members can visit the Live Well Wake website to investigate the tables (instead of scrolling to the appendix of the report document) and use the dataset to conduct their own exploratory analyses or create their own visualizations.\n*Note: While the report meets WCAG 2.0 guidelines, the webpage it‚Äôs hosted on does not."

    "text": "Stick to a Single Approach\nWhile leveraging data repositories was helpful in streamlining the analysis of roughly 50% of our indicators, we still had to source data for the remaining half.\nMoving forward, I‚Äôd lean towards recommending a single approach to our partners (i.e., everything from NC data tools) to truly streamline these efforts, acknowledging that there may be a handful of indicators unique to local interests that we track down outside of the data tools. This would free up our time, allowing us to focus on meaningfully interpreting, visualizing, and presenting the data."

However, there‚Äôs work to be done to make the data more accessible. For example, I‚Äôd love to think through how we can incorporate more interactive components for users. While several exciting and shiny ideas come to mind, I‚Äôm interested in asking community members, steering committee members, and our partners what‚Äôs on their wishlist."
