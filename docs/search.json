    "text": "Key Insight\nWake County is divided into 8 service zones. This map shows that the most socially vulnerable communities are clustered together, concentrated in the East Central service zone and nearby tracts on the borders of the North Central, South Central, and West Central service zones. On the other hand, the least socially vulnerable communities are more distinctly spread across the county in the Northern, North Central, West, and South Central service zones. We can use this information to help inform which tracts and service zones county-level investments should go to."

    "text": "Key Insight\nOf the 10 tracts identified as the most socially vulnerable areas, 4 are designated Opportunity Zones by the city of Raleigh. This overlap suggests the initiative is targeting areas with high social vulnerability, but could do better. Expanding Opportunity Zone tract eligibility beyond poverty and income measures could lead to improved social vulnerability among communities that have been historically marginalized. Policymakers should consider additional investment incentive programs for communities with lower rates of educational attainment and higher rates of severe housing problems, for example."
