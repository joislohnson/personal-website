This map shows that the most socially vulnerable communities are clustered together, concentrated in the East Central service zone and nearby tracts on the borders of the North Central, South Central, and West Central service zones. On the other hand, the least socially vulnerable communities are more distinctly spread across the county in the Northern, North Central, West, and South Central service zones. We can use this information to help inform which tracts and service zones county-level investments should go to."

This overlap suggests the initiative is targeting areas with high social vulnerability, but could do better. Expanding Opportunity Zone tract eligibility beyond poverty and income measures could lead to improved social vulnerability among communities that have been historically marginalized. Policymakers should consider additional investment incentive programs for communities with lower rates of educational attainment and higher rates of severe housing problems, for example."

    "text": "Project Overview\nThe Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Health Equity Data Consortium (HEDC) is a strategic collaboration of 10 HBCU and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) across North Carolina working to address health disparities among underserved communities in our state.\nFrom February 2023 to February 2024, the HBCU HEDC deployed the COVID-19 Impact Survey to address critical data gaps on the pandemic’s impact on households across NC. Our team at the North Carolina Institute for Public Health (NCIPH) provided technical assistance for survey methods, analysis, and dissemination.\n\n\nData Analysis Workgroup\nTasked with providing capacity building support for wrangling, analyzing, and visualizing survey results, I helped form a Data Analysis Workgroup composed of faculty and students from all 10 universities within the HBCU HEDC.\nI’d be remiss not to mention some of the members of the workgroup: Dr. Scott Bradshaw (ECSU), Dr. Sabina Otienoburu (JCSU), Dr. Cynthia Williams Brown (WSSU), Dr. Martie Thompson (App State), Dr. Sherry Leviner (FSU), Melvin Jackson (Shaw/UNC-CH), Dr. Anderton-Georgie (Shaw), Dr. Dorothy C. Browne (Shaw), Dr. Nicole Diggs (NCCU), Dr. Irene Doherty (NCCU), Dr. Joe West (UNC Pembroke), Dr. Yiqing Yang (WCU), Dr. Ashley Sanderlin (NCAT), Dr. Miriam Wagner (NCAT), DeNita Murdock-Nash (NC SCHS), Dr. John Wallace (UNC-CH), and Jaquayla Hodges (UNC-CH). Shout-out to all of these amazing folks!\n\n\n\nIn-person meeting at NC A&T on January 25, 2024.\n\n\n\n\nLeveraging Open-Source Tools\nWe wanted to choose a primary programming language for the analysis. Understandably, members of the workgroup had a variety of preferred, mostly licensed programming languages. I selected R as the primary language because it’s free, open-source, conducive to literate programming and research reproducibility, and there’s an unparalleled volume of self-learning resources.\nOur team at NCIPH led R workshops, compiled relevant R resources, and developed shared code for transforming raw results, descriptive statistics, and univariate regression. The workgroup used R Markdown, Quarto, and Shiny to report results, ultimately using the output as a basis for coding and analysis decisions, exploratory analyses, and dissemination of findings to NC communities.\n\n\n\nImpact of workshops, shared code, R Markdown, Quarto, and Shiny.\n\n\n\n\nuseR! Talk\nIn July 2024, I had the opportunity to give a talk about this work at the useR! conference in Salzburg, Austria. In addition to the content mentioned above, I discussed how convening a Data Analysis Workgroup and using free, open-source R packages and tools can serve as an engaging framework to bolster data science education and autonomy.\nI encouraged fellow data scientists to:\n\nBreak out of the silo we too often find ourselves in by forming data workgroups tailored to project context\nDemystify data science by meaningfully engaging folks throughout the data lifecycle\nPromote data democratization by using free and open source tools (okay R!)"
